My solution to the OIT coding challenge
## Time Taken
Roughly 3 hours, 40 minutes

## Process
For my Roman numeral converter, I chose to write my code in Python. Since user interface wasn't specified in the assignment, I decided to write a simple function that takes input from the user and evaluates it one Roman numeral or number at a time. To start I wrote a simple menu interface that allows the user to choose whether to convert a numeral to a number, a number to a numeral, or to exit the program. Once the user has chosen a function to use, the program asks for input. I decided to check the input of Roman numerals and raise an error if the input was invalid; however, I didn't do the same for the numbers to numerals because I figured it would be safe to assume that the user would be able to put in a valid number. The prgram converts the input to the desired output and informs the user in a print statement including their original input and its converted output. With more time I would have liked to clean up my code a bit as I feel that there may be parts that could be refactored and clarified. I started out writing detailed comments for functions and their steps but realized that with the time constraints I wouldn't be able to continue that practice. I would've liked to add something to catch errors on the number side even if it seems less important than with the numeral input.
